/*
 * NetBeans Debugging Tools. What are these tools and why are they important?
 * There are two main tools here. The first tool is a tool for delaying or
 * stopping gvim during startup.  The second tool is a protocol log tool.
 *
 * The startup delay tool is called nbdebug_wait(). This is very important for
 * debugging startup problems because gvim will be started automatically from
 * netbeans and cannot be run directly from a debugger. The only way to debug
 * a gvim started by netbeans is by attaching a debugger to it. Without this
 * tool all startup code will have completed before you can get the pid and
 * attach.
 *
 * The second tool is a log tool.
 *
 * This code must have NBDEBUG defined for it to be compiled into vim/gvim.
